
## Problem Statement
Create a C++ program that calculates the areas of various shapes (circle, rectangle, triangle, and square) using function overloading and default parameters, while also implementing function overriding through inheritance. The program should allow users to input dimensions for each shape, utilizing a base class Shape with a virtual calculateArea method that is overridden in each derived class to provide specific area calculations.
## Solution Hint
Use Function Overloading , Function Overriding
## Learning
This project illustrates the principles of function overloading, function overriding, default parameters, and static polymorphism in C++. It demonstrates how to effectively organize code to manage multiple shape types, allowing for tailored behavior in derived classes while simplifying function calls through default parameter values.
