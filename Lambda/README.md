# Lambda Expressions in C++

## Problem Statement  
Create a C++ class `LambdaEvaluator` that demonstrates the use of lambda expressions for addition, subtraction, multiplication of two integers, and sorting a vector of integers. Display the results of each operation.

## Solution Hint  
Implement the class with methods that use lambda functions to perform the arithmetic operations and sorting. Use `std::sort` with a lambda expression for sorting the vector.

## Learning  
This project helps in understanding how lambda expressions can simplify code and provide a cleaner syntax for operations in C++. You will learn how to use lambda functions effectively in various contexts, including sorting and arithmetic operations.
