# Student List Management System

## Problem Statement
Create a C++ program that manages a list of student names using arrays and strings. The program allows users to add new student names, display all names, search for a specific name, and remove names from the list. The program should handle resizing of the array as needed.

## Solution Hint
Utilize a dynamic array to store student names and implement functions to handle adding, displaying, searching, and removing names. Ensure to manage memory efficiently and display appropriate messages based on user interactions.

## Learning
This project demonstrates how to manipulate arrays and strings in C++. It emphasizes memory management, user input handling, and the importance of dynamic arrays for scalable data management.
