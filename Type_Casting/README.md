# Type Casting in C++

## Problem Statement  
Create a C++ class `TypeCaster` that demonstrates both implicit and explicit typecasting. The class should have methods that convert a `double` to an `int` and a `float` to a `char`. The functionality should include displaying the results of these conversions.

## Solution Hint  
Implement the class with appropriate member variables to hold the input values and converted results. Use implicit casting for the `double` to `int` conversion and explicit casting for the `float` to `char` conversion.

## Learning  
This project helps in understanding the differences between implicit and explicit typecasting in C++. You will learn how to manage data types effectively and the importance of type safety in C++ programming.
