# Calculator with Template in C++

## Problem Statement
Create a generic `Calculator` class template that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) for two numbers of any data type. Handle division by zero using exception handling and evaluate functionality by instantiating the template with different types.

## Solution Hint
- Define a class template to handle different data types.
- Implement basic arithmetic functions and use exception handling for division by zero.
- Test the class with various data types like `int` and `double`.

## Learning
- Understanding how to create and use class templates.
- Learn about exception handling in the context of templates.
- Explore instantiating templates with different data types.
