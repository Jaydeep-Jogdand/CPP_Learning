## Problem Statement  
Create a C++ class `Box` with private members for length, width, and height. Implement a copy constructor that duplicates the properties of one `Box` object into another. Test the functionality of the copy constructor by modifying one of the copied objects and observing the changes in both.

## Solution Hint  
- Implement a class `Box` with a parameterized constructor and a copy constructor.
- Use the copy constructor to create a new object from an existing one and modify the copied object to evaluate the effect on the original object.

## Learning  
This project highlights the use of copy constructors in C++. It demonstrates how a copy constructor copies object properties and illustrates the difference between modifying copied and original objects, reinforcing the concept of deep and shallow copying.
