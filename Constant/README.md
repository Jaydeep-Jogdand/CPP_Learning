# Circle Class Using const Keyword

## Problem Statement  
Create a C++ class `Circle` that uses the `const` keyword to ensure that the radius of the circle cannot be changed after it is set. The class should include methods to calculate the area and circumference of the circle, both of which should be constant member functions.

## Solution Hint  
Implement a class `Circle` with a constant member variable for the radius. Use constant member functions to retrieve the radius, calculate the area, and calculate the circumference, ensuring that these methods do not modify the class state.

## Learning  
This project demonstrates how the `const` keyword enforces immutability in C++. You'll learn how to create methods that guarantee no modifications to class members and use constant members to prevent reassignment, promoting safer and more reliable code.
