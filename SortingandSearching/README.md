# Project Title: "E-commerce Product Sorting and Search Engine"
## Project Description:
Build a system for an E-commerce platform that allows users to:

Sort products based on various criteria (price, rating, name) using both Bubble Sort and Quick Sort. Sorting can be done in ascending or descending order.
Use function pointers to choose different comparison functions dynamically (e.g., by price, rating, or name).
Implement a binary search algorithm to search for products by name or price range after sorting.
Compare the custom sorting implementations with C++'s standard sorting functions (std::sort) for performance.
Store and manage products dynamically using vectors.
Include additional sorting algorithms like Merge Sort to offer more advanced options to the user.
Provide interactive menu-based input for the user to sort and search products.
## Solution:- 
Core Concepts:
Sorting Algorithms:

Implement Bubble Sort and Quick Sort manually.
Use function pointers to allow dynamic sorting based on user preferences (e.g., by price, name, or rating).
Compare with C++'s std::sort() for more efficient sorting.
Search Algorithms:

Implement a Binary Search function to search for products by name or price.
Enhance the search function to support searching in sorted arrays using different search strategies.
Product Management:

Use a Product class that stores attributes like name, price, and rating.
Dynamically manage a list of products using vectors or dynamic memory allocation.
Allow users to add, remove, and update products.
Advanced Sorting Options:

Allow the user to choose between Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, or Merge Sort for sorting.
Benchmark the performance between custom sorting implementations and std::sort

## Learning :- 
Understand and implement sorting algorithms using function pointers for dynamic comparison.
Gain experience working with binary search in real-world scenarios.
Develop skills in dynamic memory management using std::vector.
Learn performance comparison techniques between custom algorithms and the standard C++ library functions.
