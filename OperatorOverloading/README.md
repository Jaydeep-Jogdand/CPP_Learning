## Problem Statement:
Implement a MyString class that mimics some basic functionality of standard strings. Overload the following operators:


Addition (+) to concatenate two MyString objects.

Subscript ([]) to access individual characters in the string.

Equality (==) to compare two MyString objects for equality.

Overload the output stream operator (<<) for easy printing of the MyString.

## Learning Objective:
Learn how to overload operators in custom string classes to provide intuitive syntax for string operations. give me code for this
