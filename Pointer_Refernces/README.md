# Pointers and References with Parent-Child Class

## Problem Statement  
Create a class hierarchy with a base class `Animal` and a derived class `Dog`. Use a pointer of type `Animal` to point to a `Dog` object while demonstrating the use of a reference to access derived class methods.

## Solution Hint  
Implement methods in both classes for sound and information. Use both a pointer to the base class and a reference to the derived class to demonstrate functionality.

## Learning  
This project illustrates the use of pointers to base classes and references to derived classes. You will learn how to leverage polymorphism and method overriding in C++, allowing for dynamic behavior based on object types.
