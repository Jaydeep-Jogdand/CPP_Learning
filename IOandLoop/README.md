
## Problem Statement
Input: Read a date in the format DD/MM/YYYY and extract and print the day, month, and year separately.
## Solution Hint
Use cin.get() to parse each part of the date and skip the / characters.
## Learning
The project demonstrates how to read formatted input from the user using cin and cin.get(). This is useful for parsing data that includes delimiters.
## Skipping Characters: 
The use of cin.get() to skip over specific characters (in this case, the / separators) is a practical technique for handling formatted input.
